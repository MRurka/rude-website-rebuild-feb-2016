Listening to Mike Monteiro was an eye opener for my back in fall 2015. 

His talk titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ucEt-La9w" target="_blank">How Designers Destroyed The World</a>” was the catalyst to the realization I had to leave my wonderful job and seek the moral high ground of deliberate, ethical design. A whirlwind of emotions to say the least. A story for later.

It’s fair to say there’s an objective difference in nobility between a designer who cares solely of income and/or personal gain in their practice, and a designer who cares solely of humanity in their practice. Granted, it's a shallow comparison but nonetheless illustrates my point to come.

First off, this (skewed) comparison occurs largely in part by the widespread democratization of design products, knowledge and the growth of demand for design in the commercial space. A likely contributer being the growing necessity for businesses to be online-relevant in a continual and ever evolving tech space. 

<b>The point of all this</b><br>
I started out practicing Graphic Design in college. Hailing from zero without even an awareness of design: I drove to create sexy work. I think everyone begins this way (especially in graphic design?). However not too long after, effectiveness became part of the equation and quickly became more important than aesthetics. I created work for myself, my portfolio and my ego. 

Two years later, I discover truly the altruistic philosophy of design. Or dare I say: the true meaning of design. And so, this quickly consumed me and this is where I am today. Between two camps: 

- <b>First</b> / The aesthetic, artistic, superficial and the ego. 
- <b>Second</b> / The effectiveness, objective value, and the human centric value of design, with considerations of environment, present and future.

Every great designer has this internal conversation with themselves. And coincidentally, a few days after beginning this post, I read the following in the final pages of The Design of Every Day Things, by Don Norman. He inadvertently touches on this aspect of difference:

<p class="quote">
“That design affects society is hardly news to designers. Many take the implications of their work seriously. But the conscious manipulation of society has severe drawbacks, not the least of which is the facet that not everyone agrees on the appropriate goals. Design, therefor takes on political significance; indeed, design philosophies vary in important ways across political systems. In Western cultures, design has reflected the capitalistic importance of the marketplace, with an emphasis on exterior features deemed to be attractive to the purchaser. In the consumer economy, taste is not the criterion in the marketing of expensive foods, or drinks, usability is not eh primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appliances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use.

As design culture and design awareness grows (AND assuming the language doesn't change before the will), there will be a universal awareness concerning the differences between a “designer” and a designer. The latter will be those who uphold the craft ethically, solving problems. The former will be anything else. Today, it’s understandably easy to lump these two designers together. Though, within (and peripheral) in the community, it isn’t difficult to point out how and where true design can have an impact.

True of the world of design for large scale because such endeavours can take up to a few years to complete. Often enough, future repercussions are seldom considered (or unknown) and only discovered when they occur. Worst of all, things often only get fixed when things go wrong. For example, in very recent news: the <b>Flint water crisis.</b>

<p class="quote">
The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint Michigan, United States, that <b>started in April 2014</b>. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River, its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger. <b>The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of lead</b>. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have severely high levels of lead in the blood and experienced a range of serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the county that has killed 10 people and affected another 77.<span class="source"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis" target="_blank">Wikipedia / Flint water crisis</a></span>
</p>

Large scale design is like a firing range in a populated area. In this case however, it takes months or years to pull the trigger. The bullet also travels months or years before reaching its target (if it even does). And missing the target means the bullet travels months or years, likely either in the way of people or environment. Environment usually takes the bullet (it can't sue you directly). Gun analogies seem appropriate here because they're relatively dangerous and potentially lethal. And so is design, in many ways.

Give a gun to an experienced marksman (designer), and he or she will much better anticipate the outcome given the knowledge and experience of the gun, distance, ammunition type, wind speed, and concerning very long distances: the <b>Coriolis force.</b>

<p class="quote">
Because of the rotation of the Earth, a bullet does not fly straight from the barrel to a target. The Coriolis effect minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, curving the path of the projectile into a more arched 'semi-circle' shape. This effect only affects accuracy at extremely long distances and is therefore adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers and other trained professionals. <span class="source"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force" target="_blank">Wikipedia / Coriolis force / Bullets at high velocity through the atmosphere</a></span>
</p>

That Coriolis bit was irrelevant, I know. But it's interesting.

To close and reiterate: These are two very real camps in the world of design, and the comparison is fundamentally incorrect (although it's right). These are easily mixed because they both interact with the same people, tools and environments. What's important is recognizing that giving the gun to the inexperienced or relatively careless designer can be -- and truthfully is -- very dangerous. 

So, if I may (and forgive me for the quotes), give the gun to the <b>designer</b>, not the <b>"designer"</b>. 

With love,
