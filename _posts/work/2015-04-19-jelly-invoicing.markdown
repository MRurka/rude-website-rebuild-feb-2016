A flexible solution for producing invoices and keeping them neatly organized on your local or shared drive.

Extending <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>'s ability to easily create static web pages (blogs) with its many blog-aware features, Jelly has been adapted to output invoices in place of blogs. Jelly calculates for you, hourly or fixed pricing, with or without tax needs.

Check out <a href="http://mrurka.github.io/jelly-invoice-website/" target="_blank">Jelly Invoicing version 1.0</a> to download the code, or simply check out the <a href="http://mrurka.github.io/jelly-invoice/" target="_blank">Demo</a>.
