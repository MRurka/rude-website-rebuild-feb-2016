You'll hear me say, "Design is my life". I like to fantasize this is my calling. Though, I can't reasonably believe this given my serendipitous involvement in design.

Long story (not so) short: Upon graduating high school, I spent few months in Montreal (hardly) working and (obsessively) pracicing Kung Fu. August swings around and mum suggests I try the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design (NBCCD). A small technical college in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericton" target="_blank">hometown</a>. Luckily for mum, one of my life goals was becoming a better artist. So I very casually said "sure". The idea of a profession in the arts, or related, was nonexistent. 

<b>Year 1</b>, didn't take it very seriously. The Foundation Visual Arts Certificate Program (1 year). I hated writing papers, enjoyed drawing. Most importantly, this is where I discovered in fact there are professions in art, craft and design.

<b>Year 2</b> comes around and I chose the Graphic Design Diploma Program (2 years). My decision was based on two things: I liked drawing and (I thought) it had better job placement than the alternatives (sorry potters). Some very trivial reasoning.

I had a talent for graphic design. I excelled and enjoyed feeling above my class. So I tried even harder and kept things serious (sometimes too serious). As opposed to my foundation year marks (C-B-A range), I made only A's since. Not to boast; Just a fact that contributed to my young ego, and in turn, where I am today. 

<b>Year 3</b> was basically a continuation of year 2, but with an added drive to create effective (not only sexy) work. My ego was even more on high (justifiably, I was a kid). Naive enough to graduate thinking I could freelance my way to the top! The spirit of entrepreneurship and/or simply running my own ship never ceased to interest me. The young and naive fantasy of being self employed.

<b>Year 4</b> I worked at a local agency, designing and building WordPress websites for 8 months before breaking down crying in front of my boss unexpectedly. Caused by months of dissatisfaction with my work and the reason I did the work. Soon after, confessing I'd been doing freelance work with the company laptop. And soon after that, I write my letter of resignation. Above all, forever will I appreciate everything they've done for me.

I then go work "part/full-time" for a local startup (who I've for/with since summer of Year 2). Fast forward 2 months: that doesn't work out. Distraught, I jump on a train bound for Toronto to visit my beloved. I made a weekend stop in Ottawa for a Startup Weekend. I met Adrian Seeley who later leads me to a full-time startup gig in Montreal, Hive (a.k.a. Nu Messenger). They'd been accepted into <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/" target="_blank">FounderFuel (renown Canadian startup incubator)</a>.

<b>Year 5</b> begins with the failure of Hive. I immediately get picked up by <a href="https://www.selectivefew.com/" target="_blank">Selective Few</a> (also hailing from <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/" target="_blank">FounderFuel</a>). Full-time, nice office, good salary and I worked with some amazing boys (I mean this endearingly). Fast forward 7 months: I put in my notice, the company folds a day later, my girlfriend and I break up, and I'm on a flight to Asia for 6 weeks to seek out design enlightenment.

A few months leading up to my notice, I grew dissatisfied with my work, and reason I was doing the work. Sound familiar? The similar sentiment I had while working at the agency (you know, where I broke bawling). The tipping point (<a href="http://rurkadesign.com/blog/blog/2016/01/31/two-designers.html">briefly mentioned in my previous post</a>) was a talk by Mike Monteiro titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ucEt-La9w" target="_blank">How Designers Destroyed the World</a>. The rush so visceral, like concrete in my stomach, I had to sit down and take a walk. My deepest self overtook by this emotional epiphany. I then knew what I had to do. 

Part 2, later. My design enlightenment.
