        <title>Embody Design (Part_1)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear me say, “Design is my life”. I like to fantasize this is my calling. Though, I can’t reasonably believe this given my serendipitous involvement in design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story (not so) short: Upon graduating high school, I spent few months in Montreal (hardly) working and (obsessively) pracicing Kung Fu. August swings around and mum suggests I try the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design (NBCCD). A small technical college in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hometown&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for mum, one of my life goals was becoming a better artist. So I very casually said “sure”. The idea of a profession in the arts, or related, was nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year 1&lt;/b&gt;, didn’t take it very seriously. The Foundation Visual Arts Certificate Program (1 year). I hated writing papers, enjoyed drawing. Most importantly, this is where I discovered in fact there are professions in art, craft and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year 2&lt;/b&gt; comes around and I chose the Graphic Design Diploma Program (2 years). My decision was based on two things: I liked drawing and (I thought) it had better job placement than the alternatives (sorry potters). Some very trivial reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a talent for graphic design. I excelled and enjoyed feeling above my class. So I tried even harder and kept things serious (sometimes too serious). As opposed to my foundation year marks (C-B-A range), I made only A’s since. Not to boast; Just a fact that contributed to my young ego, and in turn, where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year 3&lt;/b&gt; was basically a continuation of year 2, but with an added drive to create effective (not only sexy) work. My ego was even more on high (justifiably, I was a kid). Naive enough to graduate thinking I could freelance my way to the top! The spirit of entrepreneurship and/or simply running my own ship never ceased to interest me. The young and naive fantasy of being self employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year 4&lt;/b&gt; I worked at a local agency, designing and building WordPress websites for 8 months before breaking down crying in front of my boss unexpectedly. Caused by months of dissatisfaction with my work and the reason I did the work. Soon after, confessing I’d been doing freelance work with the company laptop. And soon after that, I write my letter of resignation. Above all, forever will I appreciate everything they’ve done for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then go work “part/full-time” for a local startup (who I’ve for/with since summer of Year 2). Fast forward 2 months: that doesn’t work out. Distraught, I jump on a train bound for Toronto to visit my beloved. I made a weekend stop in Ottawa for a Startup Weekend. I met Adrian Seeley who later leads me to a full-time startup gig in Montreal, Hive (a.k.a. Nu Messenger). They’d been accepted into &lt;a href=&quot;http://founderfuel.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FounderFuel (renown Canadian startup incubator)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year 5&lt;/b&gt; begins with the failure of Hive. I immediately get picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selectivefew.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selective Few&lt;/a&gt; (also hailing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://founderfuel.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FounderFuel&lt;/a&gt;). Full-time, nice office, good salary and I worked with some amazing boys (I mean this endearingly). Fast forward 7 months: I put in my notice, the company folds a day later, my girlfriend and I break up, and I’m on a flight to Asia for 6 weeks to seek out design enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months leading up to my notice, I grew dissatisfied with my work, and reason I was doing the work. Sound familiar? The similar sentiment I had while working at the agency (you know, where I broke bawling). The tipping point (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rurkadesign.com/blog/blog/2016/01/31/two-designers.html&quot;&gt;briefly mentioned in my previous post&lt;/a&gt;) was a talk by Mike Monteiro titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ucEt-La9w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How Designers Destroyed the World&lt;/a&gt;. The rush so visceral, like concrete in my stomach, I had to sit down and take a walk. My deepest self overtook by this emotional epiphany. I then knew what I had to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2, later. My design enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Designers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Listening to Mike Monteiro was an eye opener for my back in fall 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His talk titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ucEt-La9w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How Designers Destroyed The World&lt;/a&gt;” was the catalyst to the realization I had to leave my wonderful job and seek the moral high ground of deliberate, ethical design. A whirlwind of emotions to say the least. A story for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say there’s an objective difference in nobility between a designer who cares solely of income and/or personal gain in their practice, and a designer who cares solely of humanity in their practice. Granted, it’s a shallow comparison but nonetheless illustrates my point to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, this (skewed) comparison occurs largely in part by the widespread democratization of design products, knowledge and the growth of demand for design in the commercial space. A likely contributer being the growing necessity for businesses to be online-relevant in a continual and ever evolving tech space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The point of all this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I started out practicing Graphic Design in college. Hailing from zero without even an awareness of design: I drove to create sexy work. I think everyone begins this way (especially in graphic design?). However not too long after, effectiveness became part of the equation and quickly became more important than aesthetics. I created work for myself, my portfolio and my ego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, I discover truly the altruistic philosophy of design. Or dare I say: the true meaning of design. And so, this quickly consumed me and this is where I am today. Between two camps: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;First&lt;/b&gt; / The aesthetic, artistic, superficial and the ego. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt; / The effectiveness, objective value, and the human centric value of design, with considerations of environment, present and future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every great designer has this internal conversation with themselves. And coincidentally, a few days after beginning this post, I read the following in the final pages of The Design of Every Day Things, by Don Norman. He inadvertently touches on this aspect of difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
“That design affects society is hardly news to designers. Many take the implications of their work seriously. But the conscious manipulation of society has severe drawbacks, not the least of which is the facet that not everyone agrees on the appropriate goals. Design, therefor takes on political significance; indeed, design philosophies vary in important ways across political systems. In Western cultures, design has reflected the capitalistic importance of the marketplace, with an emphasis on exterior features deemed to be attractive to the purchaser. In the consumer economy, taste is not the criterion in the marketing of expensive foods, or drinks, usability is not eh primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appliances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use. 
&lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Design-Everyday-Things-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;refRID=02CXE7KMC5989M5GSQNM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition, by Don Norman&lt;/a&gt; - It&#39;s an Amazon link. Go buy it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As design culture and design awareness grows (AND assuming the language doesn’t change before the will), there will be a universal awareness concerning the differences between a “designer” and a designer. The latter will be those who uphold the craft ethically, solving problems. The former will be anything else. Today, it’s understandably easy to lump these two designers together. Though, within (and peripheral) in the community, it isn’t difficult to point out how and where true design can have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True of the world of design for large scale because such endeavours can take up to a few years to complete. Often enough, future repercussions are seldom considered (or unknown) and only discovered when they occur. Worst of all, things often only get fixed when things go wrong. For example, in very recent news: the &lt;b&gt;Flint water crisis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint Michigan, United States, that &lt;b&gt;started in April 2014&lt;/b&gt;. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River, its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger. &lt;b&gt;The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of lead&lt;/b&gt;. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have severely high levels of lead in the blood and experienced a range of serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires&#39; disease in the county that has killed 10 people and affected another 77.&lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia / Flint water crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large scale design is like a firing range in a populated area. In this case however, it takes months or years to pull the trigger. The bullet also travels months or years before reaching its target (if it even does). And missing the target means the bullet travels months or years, likely either in the way of people or environment. Environment usually takes the bullet (it can’t sue you directly). Gun analogies seem appropriate here because they’re relatively dangerous and potentially lethal. And so is design, in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give a gun to an experienced marksman (designer), and he or she will much better anticipate the outcome given the knowledge and experience of the gun, distance, ammunition type, wind speed, and concerning very long distances: the &lt;b&gt;Coriolis force.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
Because of the rotation of the Earth, a bullet does not fly straight from the barrel to a target. The Coriolis effect minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, curving the path of the projectile into a more arched &#39;semi-circle&#39; shape. This effect only affects accuracy at extremely long distances and is therefore adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers and other trained professionals. &lt;span class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia / Coriolis force / Bullets at high velocity through the atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Coriolis bit was irrelevant, I know. But it’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close and reiterate: These are two very real camps in the world of design, and the comparison is fundamentally incorrect (although it’s right). These are easily mixed because they both interact with the same people, tools and environments. What’s important is recognizing that giving the gun to the inexperienced or relatively careless designer can be – and truthfully is – very dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I may (and forgive me for the quotes), give the gun to the &lt;b&gt;designer&lt;/b&gt;, not the &lt;b&gt;“designer”&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With love, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Michael Rurka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Selective Few</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Designer, 9 months.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective Few is an Ecommerce company that sells rare fashion from the worlds top boutiques. Empowering traditional brick and mortar boutiques with a beautiful online presence and the reach of a global market. Selective Few is also a graduate of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://founderfuel.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FounderFuel Program&lt;/a&gt;, one of Canada’s top startup incubator, based in Montreal, QC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;clear&quot; src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w2&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/sf/sf-home.jpg&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;img class=&quot;w2&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/sf/sf-product.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the Creative Director, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-peker/2a/539/779&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andrew Peker&lt;/a&gt;, we produce various content that accurately reflect the brand, as well as the uncompromising quality of the products we sold. I also worked closely with the development team, working out the best possible user experiences within our start-up-driven limitations. Product Development Process was typically: Research, exploration and working with Creative Director to produce mock ups for the development team. Once the mockups were built and functional, they were be passed back to me for style touch ups (CSS) and final QA. At SF, I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conducted research in Ecommerce practicies, statistics, trends. Aiding design decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed website layouts, user experience and UI general elements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created visual brand material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created marketting material for social media and Google Ads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coded large parts of the website styles (CSS) and often looked after the responsive CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coded some parts of the HTML, if the development team needed an extra hand.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Polished the website elements and various parts as they were built, with CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Nu Messenger</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design Lead, 6 months.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TL;DR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nu Messenger is an accessible, lightweight, hyper fast messaging app centered around topical discussions. Below, you’ll see an evolution of versions as we progressed through the development of Nu Messenger. Our team was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.linkedin.com/in/adrianseeley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adrian Seeley&lt;/a&gt;, machine learning data wizard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/jean-rené-carle-mossdorf/13/882/a10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jean-René Carle&lt;/a&gt;, business and finance guru.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Myself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nu Messenger is the product of a divergent evolution from Hive, which was initially destined to be a Social Media Managing platform for businesses of any size. Going through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://founderfuel.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FounderFuel&lt;/a&gt; Hive pivoted to become the holy grail of commenting plugins, similar to Disqus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commenting world is limited to the boundaries of it’s environment (e.g. an article on a news site). We envisioned a world of no boundaries, where you could easily comment, with zero barriers to entry, and also take it away with you on the go, in app form, web or native. From there, we were inevitably creating a communication platform, centered around topics. And this is where we narrowed our energy to develope an MVP messenger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;clear&quot; src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w1&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/header-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w3&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/nu-home-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w4&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/nu-app-store-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;clear&quot; src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w1&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/header-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w3&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/nu-home-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w4&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/nu-screens-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;clear&quot; src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w1&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/header-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w3&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/nu/nu-screens-3.gif&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Jelly Invoice V1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A flexible solution for producing invoices and keeping them neatly organized on your local or shared drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;’s ability to easily create static web pages (blogs) with its many blog-aware features, Jelly has been adapted to output invoices in place of blogs. Jelly calculates for you, hourly or fixed pricing, with or without tax needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Naive Prowess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pen &amp;amp; digital illustration published in the Applied Arts Magazine, 2013 Student Awards Edition and subsiquently nominated for an AACE Award (top 10). Full details here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appliedartsmag.com/winners_gallery/archive/?id=1086&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;clip=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Applied Arts Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;clear&quot; src=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;w4&quot; src=&quot;./img/work/winter/naive-prowess.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I virtually only ever paint and draw elephants. Naive Prowess is an exploration that meshed both design and illustration. It was a new way to utilize my drawings and incorporate my graphic design practice. The overall look and feel, and desire to expose various layers comes from my attraction to blatant brush strokes in painting. It seems more intimate and provides an additional perspective into how the piece was created.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rurking Hard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flip 1:&lt;/b&gt; Awareness of a design entity. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flip 2:&lt;/b&gt; Visceral intrigue, reading &lt;i&gt;“Fucking long”&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flip 3:&lt;/b&gt; Eyes continue, reading &lt;i&gt;“Fucking long and hard”&lt;/i&gt;. Moving onto the tagline below incites the double take, figuring out the profanity actually reads “Rurking long and hard”.&lt;/p&gt;
